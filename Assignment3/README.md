**Big Number Calculator in C**

The assignment contains the code for implementing the calculations for big numbers which have sizes even larger than long long int.

The source for the implementation of addition, subtraction, and multiplication algorithms is attached in a document titled week4.pdf . An efficient algorithm for performing division was designed personally by me and used.
